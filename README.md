# Kensington Rule Engine

## Requirements

1. NodeJS
2. Bower (after installing Node and NPM run `npm install -g bower`)

## Building

1.  Clone this repo
2.  Open a Terminal or Command Prompt and run `npm install && bower install`
3.  `grunt build` to build distributables

## Testing

Fixtures are generated by templates, so that we do not have to manually manage references to tests and source files.  Due to Cross-Origin restrictions, you must run a fixture server before running the tests.

There are a couple options for running tests and the fixture server:

1. `grunt server` - This will generate the fixtures and start a server at http://localhost:9876/
2. `grunt connect watch` - This will start the server and also re-generate fixtures and distributables any time a source file or test is changed.
